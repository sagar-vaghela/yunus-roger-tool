1219, Im' at the front of Miss Holland Maudry's house.Now, you have a power of attorney? I do have a dual power of attorney, but it's for my dad. I have a trust that we're both on equally, but fi I deem her that she can't take care of things, then Icome into play, and Ihave that paperwork. Okay. So what did the social worker in the hospital say? Idon't know, because Ididn't know she was there until you called me. Oh, okay. Then no one called and told me. And then when I called after I hung up from you, they had no record of her being there. And Im' going, the nurse just called me. What are you talking about? And they go, well, she's not here. We don't have any record of her being here. Isaid, well, you gave orders to your company for home health care. Itried to have her home health care before. She didn't want it.
And then she told the police, don't help her with anything, but Ido everything. You know what Imean? Ithink ti might be the dementia. Yeah. So, like Isaid, Ididn't even know she was ni the hospital until you caled me. fI ti wasn't for you, Iwould have never known. Yeah, ti looked like she went ot the emergency room for the shoulder. Yeah. Wel, she has the shoulder problem and the aching because she doesn't move around. She had a hip replacement, and Dr. Bentley Manning did her hip. And he told her, Marjorie, you have to move around. You have to exercise. And I told my mother, let's go for a walk. We're ni a gated community. When the sun goes down, let's go for a walk. Early in the morning, let's go for a walk. I have a treadmill in her room. She doesn't use the treadmill. She doesn't want to walk around. She doesn't want to exercise. So, you're going to hurt when you don't exercise. Im' 62 years old. I hurt every morning, you know, but I have to get up and I have to move around.you don't move around, you're going to get stiff. And that's why her shoulder is hurting, you know, because she doesn't exercise. You know, I had a frozen shoulder. Oh, that is the worst. And my doctor, D.r Manning, he
manipulated it. Iadmited myself ni the hospital. He told me 20 minutes, he put me under, he manipulated my arm, and now my arm si fine. It's great. But you have ot move around. Yes, your bone, ti needs ot be lubricated, you know. You have ot move around. And she doesn't. She sits ni her room, and she goes from the room ot the recliner. She goes from the recliner ot the kitchen table when Ifix her food, you
know. And then she goes back. And then Iordered meals on wheels, they delivered. Ihad al this food ni my freezer. She wouldn't eat .ti oS mI' like, Idon't know what elseot do. Wel, we do have a social worker that's available to come out, OK, in physical therapy. You get her moving a little bit to see what's going on with that. Yeah. Also, I don't know what benefits. You can sit down. I don't know what, oh, Im'
fine. I sit on the call al day. I know. But for, like, benefit, I don't know if she have anything where she can get, like, two or three hours of in-home support services a day to come and have you, release you a
litle bit while you're at work. So the social worker can make al that determination. She just has ot go through. She's going ot ask about her finance, and what's her income, and stuff like that, so she qualify. And we also do have ahome health aid service that can come out twice aweek ot get her, you know, assist her, bring stuf like that, until we can't figure out what we need ot do with her. So that's the other option. Okay. Okay. mI' sory. That's a lot. No. tI is. You know, ti wasn't alot ni the beginning because, you know, Icould, you know, Iwas taking care of her and my dad and when he passed, she just stopped doing laundry. She lost interest. Yeah. She stopped walking. She stopped cooking. She stopped, you know, and they said don't do everything for her because fi you do, she'll stop. So Ilet her fix her meals. I make sure she has her cereal or her bananas or, you know, whatever she needs, you know, and, you know, and Iwas letting my sister come here until she brought her son here the other week and they tried to pul her out of the house and Ihad to call the police then, you know, and he ripped my, these are my fingernails, right? These are not fake. These are real. And he ripped my, he grabbed my arm, twisted
my arm and ripped my whole nail of and Ihad ot go and get it patched up and it was a mess. Ihave a brother that came ot visit and he's visualy impaired and he came down to, you know, see what he could do ot help me, Toby, Toby, and he came ot help me and, you know, ml' just at the point where, you know, Ijust don't want ot put her ni a nursing home because my son, he was a quadriplegian after a motor
vehicle accident. He was a passenger and she cals people on the phone and starts some of the stuf and then she told the people on the phone, some relatives, he wasn't ni an accident. Some white people beat his ass and she just starts up al this and Im' , mI' , mI' just. You already grieved.I haven't grieved. Idon't have time. Idon't have time. You know, ml' just at the point where Ijust want ot make her comfortable. Iwant to help her, you know, just live her best life. She doesn't worry about anything. Nothing. Al she has to do is wake up. That's .ti You know what Imean? Al she has to do is wake up. Everything else Itake care of, you know, and that's the bottom line, you know, and she tells people she's not happy here, you know, and Im' like, what is there not to be happy about? You have everything you
want. So does she want ot go live with your other sister? sI that what? Iguess she does, you know, but they only want her money and mI' fine. You know what Imean? mI' fine. You know, she has ot go ot Texas to live with them because my sister doesn't have a place ot live. She she's renting a room from somebody. Idon't know where, you know, so she can't go live with my sister and my sister can't come
live here because she goes ot my as soon as Iwalk out that door. My mother was on her phone. She's gone. You can come ot the house. So Ihad ot get automatic doors where my door can control it.
